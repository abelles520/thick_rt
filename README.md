# Optically thick radiative transfer for Astro 530

### Author: Alex Belles

This repository contains the code used in Astro 530: Stellar Atmospheres for optically thick radiative transfer.
This README will be updated throughout the semester as the code base grows. The project
is laid out as follows:
 * thick_rt
   * Contains the source code created to do the homework assignments
 * scripts
   * this directory contains files named after assignments where the functions written in thick_rt will be imported to plot, etc. 
 
To install:
> `pip install -e .`
from the directory containing the `setup.py` file.
